# Definition

SEO is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible and rank higher on search engines.

# HTML - The role of the meta tag and how it affects SEO 

One way to improve your site's SEO is to provide a short description for the web page using the **meta** element.  
```html
<meta name="description" content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening" />
```
By setting the `name` attribute to "description", we make sure that browsers, search engines, and other web tools correctly interpret this metadata.
The `content` attribute is where we place our description.  

It is recommended to keep our description concise because search engines will often truncate it based on the results page layout.  

Even though meta descriptions won't directly affect a site's ranking on a search engine, having a strong description could result in more traffic to your site.
